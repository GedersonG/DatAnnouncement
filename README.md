## 1. ü§î General Information

### web application 

DatAnnouncement is a web application that offers a wide variety of products to its users. The application allows you to visualize any type of item with its detailed information such as name, price and description, and also allows you to organize them by categories.

We offer our customers the opportunity to offer products in a fast and secure way. DatAnnouncement provides a space to offer products online, with an easy to use interface, with features that make the online experience easy and convenient for users.

#### Add to Favorites:
If you find yourself interested in a product, but are not sure whether to purchase it at that time, you can add it to your "Favorites". When you click on the ‚≠ê on the product page, it will be saved in a list of products that you can access from your account at any time. This allows you to keep track of the products you are interested in and view them later without having to search for them again.

#### Filtering:
At DatAnnouncement, we offer filtering options so you can find the products you need faster and more efficiently. You can filter search results by price, category, location, and other criteria to narrow results to specific products. In addition, you can also sort results by price, popularity, novelty, and more.

#### Add, edit or delete products:
As a DatAnnouncement user, you can add new products, edit your existing product information and delete unwanted products from your account. All of this is easy to do by logging into the product and selecting the edit or delete option.

#### Add, edit or delete categories:
As an administrator in DatAnnouncement, you can add, edit or delete categories from the configuration section of the web application.

| [![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-orange)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)             | HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript). |
| [![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-blue)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)                                     | Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. |
| [![Ruby on Rails](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ruby_On_Rails-red)](https://rubyonrails.org/) | Rails is a full-stack framework. It ships with all the tools needed to build amazing web apps on both the front and back end.  |
| [![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bootsrap-purple)](https://getbootstrap.com/) | Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.

Bootstrap 5 is the newest version of Bootstrap |
| [![Dockers](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dockers-blue)](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) | Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker‚Äôs methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
